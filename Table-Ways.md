### Key Considerations for Our Project

- **Training Data from Books:**  
  Our training dataset is derived from technical books on cyber security, processed into instruction-response pairs. This domain-specific data helps the model learn detailed, specialized content.  
  [Books file used for training](https://github.com/0PeterAdel/CyberBrain/blob/main/Create-DataSet/books.jsonl)

- **Max Sequence Length (`max_seq_length`):**  
  This parameter defines the context window for the model. While a higher value (e.g., 2048) provides more context, it also requires more memory. On devices with limited GPU RAM, consider reducing this value to 1024 or even 512 to reduce resource consumption.

- **Number of Training Epochs (`num_train_epochs`):**  
  This parameter controls how many complete passes over the dataset are performed. For initial experiments on a weak device, using fewer epochs (e.g., 1‚Äì3) is advisable to reduce training time and prevent overfitting.

- **Gradient Accumulation (`gradient_accumulation_steps`):**  
  This setting simulates a larger batch size by accumulating gradients over several steps. For example, using 8 accumulation steps allows you to benefit from a larger effective batch size without increasing memory usage per step.

- **GPU Definition and Device Mapping:**  
  For GPU-based training, it is crucial to ensure that your graphics card is correctly defined and recognized before training starts. In our project, if using a GPU like the NVIDIA Quadro M620 Mobile (with ~1.956 GB VRAM), we employ custom device mapping to offload heavy components (such as transformer layers) to the CPU while keeping critical components (like embeddings and LM head) on the GPU. This balances performance and memory constraints.

### Which Method is Best for Our Project?

For training an AI model on technical books for Ethical Cyber Security on a weak device:
- **Unsloth with LoRA** is a strong candidate because it is specifically designed for efficient fine-tuning on limited hardware and is straightforward to use.
- **Hugging Face Transformers with PEFT (LoRA/QLoRA)** is also a great option, offering flexibility and further memory optimizations (with QLoRA) but may require more careful tuning.
- **DeepSpeed** and **Hugging Face Accelerate** are excellent for distributed and high-performance scenarios but might be overkill or too complex for our use case on a weak device.

Given our goals‚Äîtraining on books with domain-specific data on a device with limited GPU resources‚Äî**Unsloth with LoRA** (or a well-tuned PEFT/QLoRA approach) offers the best balance between resource consumption, ease of use, and fine-tuning accuracy.
