# CyberBrain_Model

CyberBrain_Model is an advanced AI project designed for fine-tuning the model `unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B` specifically for cyber security tasks. This repository provides tools and scripts for training and fine-tuning large language models efficiently using minimal hardware resources. The goal is to adapt the model for ethical cyber security applications, making it efficient even on devices with limited computational power, whether you have a low-end CPU or a GPU with limited VRAM.

In this project, we use technical content extracted from various cyber security sources as our primary training data. The raw text is processed into instruction-response pairs tailored for fine-tuning the model on cyber security scenarios. You can access the training data [here](./DataSet).

## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CyberBrain_Model.git
cd CyberBrain_Model
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

Create a new virtual environment (Python 3.11 is recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .env
# Activate the environment:
# On Linux/Mac:
source .env/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install torch==2.5.1+cu118 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

## ü§ñ Running the Project

- **Model Loading:** Run `Model_Loading_with_Unsloth.py` to load the model.
- **Training:** Run `Train_Start.py` to start the fine-tuning process.
- **Configurations:** Review `LoRA_Configuration.py` and `Configure_Training_Arguments.py` for training settings.

## üìÑ Additional Documentation

Refer to the following files for more details:
- `map.md`
- `Table-Ways.md`

This repository is designed to be modular and flexible, making it easy to customize for your training needs on cyber security tasks. Feel free to modify scripts and settings to suit your project requirements.

## üöÄ Quick Start on Google Colab

To quickly run CyberBrain_Model on Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Open a new Colab notebook and run:
   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CyberBrain_Model.git
   %cd CyberBrain_Model
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required packages by running:
   ```bash
   !pip install --upgrade pip
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   !pip install torch==2.5.1+cu118 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   !pip install torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   ```

3. **Open and Run `main.ipynb`**  
   Open the `main.ipynb` notebook in Colab. This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to:
   - Load the dataset from the `DataSet` directory.
   - Load the model using `Model_Loading_with_Unsloth.py`.
   - Configure training arguments via `Configure_Training_Arguments.py`.
   - Start training using `Train_Start.py`.
   - Evaluate the model and monitor training progress.
